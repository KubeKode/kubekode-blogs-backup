The Terraform Associate certification is for Cloud Engineers specializing in operations, IT, or developers who know the basic concepts and skills associated with open-source HashiCorp Terraform. Candidates will be best prepared for this exam if they have professional experience using Terraform in production, but performing the exam objectives in a personal demo environment may also be sufficient.

## Background

Before I dive into the specifics, let me give you some context. I joined my first Tech Organization early in March 2021 and as part of my project I got introduced to terraform for the first time as a DevOps Engineer.

I'm working with Terraform in a production environment for around 2 years. And I decided to upskill myself in terraform with having a validation of my skill. So I started preparing for the Terraform Associate Exam.

I dedicated around 10-20 days to preparing for the exam and was able to pass it successfully.

## **Resources That Helped Me**

### Official Terraform Documentation

As I was working with Terraform already so I was well familiar with the documentation and other resources. Whenever I stuck in some error I used documentation to solve that.

### Video based resources

* For the first time, to get started with terraform I used a youtube video by kodekloud. That video almost cleared my all doubts about terraform.
    
* But when I started preparing for the certification, I took [Terraform Associate udemy course by Zeal Vora](https://www.udemy.com/course/terraform-beginner-to-advanced/) for the preparation.
    
* You can also use other free resources from youtube as well.
    

### **Practice Exams**

I didn't try any practice exams for my certification as I was confident enough to pass the certification and also in the course itself there's a practice exam which gives enough idea of questions asked in the exam.

## **Conclusion**

In conclusion, these were the resources that I relied on for my preparation. The entire process took me around 20 days. Remember, each person's journey is unique, and what worked for me might not work for you. However, I hope that sharing my experience will provide you with some guidance and inspiration as you prepare for your Terraform Associate exam.
